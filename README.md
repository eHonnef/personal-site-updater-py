# Personal site updater

Python script to "autoupdate" my [personal website](https://honnef.dev).

## How to use

Change the `GITHUB_USER` in the `Main.py` file and list and categorize your repositories in the `Settings.json`.

Note: you need to keep the `ProcessedRepos` and `IgnoredRepos` entries, but you can clear the items without a problem.
